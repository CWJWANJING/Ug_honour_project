This is my undergraduate dissertation project.

I implemented an [algorithm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3294052.3319703) to answer queries on inconsistent databases. Optimised the implementation speed and evaluated the algorithm using quantitative approaches. Technologies used: Python, PostgreSQL
